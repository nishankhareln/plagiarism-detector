Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence by software-coded
heuristics. The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and
take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial
intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs
can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans.
Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of
huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video. Artificial intelligence
is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a
machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the simplest to those that are
even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include mimicking human
cognitive activity. Researchers and developers in the field are making surprisingly rapid
strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning, and perception, to the

extent that these can be concretely defined.
