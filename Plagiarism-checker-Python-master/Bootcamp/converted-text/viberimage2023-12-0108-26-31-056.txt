Artificial intelligence, the ability of a digital processor or computer-controlled robot to
execute activities frequently associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently
applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes
characteristics of humans, such as the capacity to deduce, unveil significance,
generalize, or glean from past experience. Since the evolution of the digital computer
in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be instructed to execute
exceedingly intricate undertakings—such as unearthing validations for mathematical
propositions or engaging in board games—with remarkable adeptness. However,
despite continuing advances in computer processing rapidity and memory capability,
there are currently no programs that can parallel complete human adaptability across
broader realms or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. Conversely, a few
applications have achieved the levels of performance levels of human experts and
professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this
limited sense is observed in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer

search engines, vocal or script recognition, and chatbots.
